# FTSE100_Trader

This project follows a very similar structure to my Market Corrections project

This code was written for a company me and my friend begun to try and identify possible profitable opportunities in financial markets.

Run backtests and set back test parameters using backtest.py

NN_models.py is where i attempted, unsuccessfully on the most part to use a neural network to predict the next days prices given the 'n' previous days.
